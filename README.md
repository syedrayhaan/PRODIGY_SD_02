## Guessing Game

**Description:**

This Python project implements a simple guessing game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, and then it displays the number of attempts it took to win.

**Features:**

* **Random number generation:** A random number is generated within the specified range.
* **User input:** The program prompts the user to enter their guess.
* **Comparison and feedback:** The guess is compared to the random number, and appropriate feedback is provided.
* **Win condition:** The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number.
* **Attempt counting:** The number of attempts made by the user is tracked and displayed.

**How to use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `guessing_game.py` file using a Python interpreter.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your guesses.
4. The game will provide feedback and continue until you guess the correct number.
